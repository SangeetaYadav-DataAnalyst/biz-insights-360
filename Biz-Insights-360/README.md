**Background:**
AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding organization, has adopted Power BI to harness the power of data analytics. This strategic initiative seeks to unlock actionable insights across key business functions, including finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain, ultimately driving informed decision-making and a sustainable competitive advantage.

I, Sangeeta Yadav, successfully executed this project by leveraging the Codebasics Power BI Course and used the following tools and techniques:

**Tech Stacks:**
- SQL for data extraction and manipulation
- Power BI Desktop for data visualization and reporting
- Excel for data preparation and analysis
- DAX language for creating calculated measures and columns
- DAX Studio for optimizing report performance
- Project charter file for defining project scope and objectives

**PowerBI Techniques Learned:**
1. _Requirements Gathering:_ Asking the right questions before starting a project
2. Data Transformation: Creating calculated columns and measures using DAX
3. Data Modeling: Designing and optimizing data structures
4. Visualization: Using Bookmarks, page navigation, and buttons for interactive reports
5. Error Handling: Preventing zero division errors using the divide function
6. Dynamic Reporting: Creating dynamic titles based on applied filters

**Company Background:**
AtliQ Hardware sells computers and accessories through retailers and direct distributors worldwide. They recently faced unexpected losses in their American store due to decisions based on surveys, intuition, and limited Excel analysis. To compete better, the company needs to build an analytics team for data-driven insights and decisions.

**Project Outcome:**
This project aims to clarify the purpose and goals of the data analytics initiative. The report generated will enable data-driven decision-making and answer numerous questions about the company's performance. It's a step towards surviving and thriving in the industry.
